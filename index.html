    <h3>about</h3>
    <p>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
      Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
      Designers are toolmakers.
      Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
      Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
      Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
<h3>hard skills</h3>
<p>stakeholder workshops design thinking exercises
  accessibility audits heuristic evaluations
  analytics audits surveys and focus groups
  moderated user testing unmoderated user testing
  card-sorting navigation tree testing</p>
